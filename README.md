This system is a combination of a web as well as an android application where the user will be using the
android application and admin as well as HR will work with the web application. This system is meant
for fieldwork users. The user will have this application on their Android devices(phone), when the user logs in to
the system his/her image will be captured and their GPS location will be sent to the admin where the admin will
view the image and GPS location in the web application. After Login, the GPS location of the employee will be
tracked automatically by the system and sent to the admin after every 5 minutes. When the user logs out of the
